					<h2>Red Bush</h2>
					<p>This picture is taken before we go home from our off campus in Villa Alfredo and not gonna lie the price is so high, P2900 for that? Bai when I was still grade 8, the fee was P2600 only and overnight, including food all day.</p>
					<p>I notice this bushes and thought "This looks nice". This image gives a feeling of early morning, around 5 AM in the foggy cold woods and stumbling a bush with small red flowers.</p>

					<h2>Flag gate</h2>
					<p>This picture is taken when we go to UP diliman before we go the Circle park. This flag is so huge. It was placed in the entrance of the university.</p>
					<p>This gives me the feeling of lovely dusk and old vintage feeling because of the sunset.</p>

					<h2>Wet red flower</h2>
					<p>This picture is taken when we attended a wedding in tagaytay. It started raining but that didn't stop me for going arround the place. I found the machine that keeps the pool clean and near the wall there's this plants that has a red flower and i take a picture of it</p>
					<p>This gives me the feeling of 9 AM of the morning, it started to rain but the clouds didn't covered the sun completely. As the rain comes to a halt, the plants around you are holding a water droplets</p>

					<h2>Vacation</h2>
					<p>This picture is taken when we attended a wedding in tagaytay. Don't mind the mess in the table, everyone was preparing for the wedding that time so no one has the time to clean that up, including me taking a picture of this nice view</p>
					<p>Almost pink sunset, while in a nice view of the mountains, making you forget all your problems and in a paradise.</p>
